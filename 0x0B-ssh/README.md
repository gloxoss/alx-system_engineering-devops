### Introduction
This project aims to set up an SSH connection to an Ubuntu server, using RSA keys for authentication. The project also explores the basics of server setup and SSH configuration.

---

### Technologies
- Bash
- SSH
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

---

### Setup

1. **Install Required Packages**: Make sure that SSH is installed onyour local machine.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install openssh-client
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
    cd 0x0B-ssh
    ```

---

### Usage
1. **To use a private key for SSH connection**
    ```bash
    ./0-use_a_private_key
    ```

2. **To generate an RSA key pair**
    ```bash
    ./1-create_ssh_key_pair
    ```

---

### Tasks
- `0-use_a_private_key`: A bash script that uses SSH to connect to your server using a private key.
- `1-create_ssh_key_pair`: A bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
- `client-configuration`: Contains SSH client configuration to connect to a server without typing a password.

---

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what a server is and where it usually lives.
- Know what SSH is and how to create an SSH RSA key pair.
- Learn how to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair.
- Understand the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.

---

### Additional Notes
- All scripts are compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All bash scripts are executable and are expected to have the first line as `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
