## Background Context

This project aims to implement configuration management using Puppet manifests. Configuration management is essential in DevOps and SysAdmin environments for maintaining standardized, automated, and reliable systems. The project tasks simulate real-world scenarios like creating files, installing packages, and executing commands on servers. The project was inspired by an experience while working on an auto-remediation tool at SlideShare, demonstrating the importance of effective configuration management.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Puppet 5.5 pre-installed
- All files should end with a newline
- Puppet manifests must pass `puppet-lint` version 2.1.1 without errors

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x0A-configuration_management.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x0A-configuration_management
    ```

## Usage

Each `.pp` file is a Puppet manifest that performs a specific task:

- `0-create_a_file.pp`: Creates a file
- `1-install_a_package.pp`: Installs flask from pip3
- `2-execute_a_command.pp`: Kills a process named `killmenow`

To apply a manifest, run:

```bash
sudo puppet apply <file-name>.pp
Files
0-create_a_file.pp: Puppet manifest for creating a file
1-install_a_package.pp: Puppet manifest for installing Flask
2-execute_a_command.pp: Puppet manifest for killing a process
